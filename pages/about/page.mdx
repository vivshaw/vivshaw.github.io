I'm a human with an inexhaustible curiosity about the intersection of technology and human life. Currently, I'm an engineering manager at [Mercury](https://mercury.com), where I lead a frontend platform team.

My professional interests are in:

- _human-computer interaction_, especially in the context of _developer tooling_ or _user interfaces_.
- _platform engineering_ (or _DevOps_, or _infrastructure engineering_, or whichever is the buzzword du jour).
- _machine learning_, especially insofar as it intersects with the above.

My amateur interests are many and cryptic. Ask me about [heraldry](https://zettel.vivsha.ws/#/page/heraldry) or [illumination](https://zettel.vivsha.ws/#/page/illumination) sometime!

I'm an alumna of the University of Vermont, with a B.A. in Economics and Philosophy, and of University of Colorado Boulder, with an M.Eng. When I'm not hacking on stuff, you'll generally find me reading weird fiction or philosophy, stir-frying things, or DJing techno sets. [Obfuscated code](https://github.com/vivshaw/three-wise-monkeys) is a side hobby of mine, as is [maintaining my homelab](https://github.com/vivshaw/homelab).

You can reach me at [hey@vivsha.ws](mailto:hey@vivsha.ws). You can find a more complete list of my online presence in [the profile card on the main page](/).
