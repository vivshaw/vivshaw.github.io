# TODO

- [ ] code blocks
  - [ ] there's an error with `'` and `"` in Prism code blocks of unknown language, they turn into &quot;&quot;
  - [ ] make `code` blocks more legible
  - [ ] line numbers in code blocks - the line number plugin for remark-mdx seems somewhat borked, won't let me select a custom starting line
  - [ ] code block highlights - the highlight plugin for remark-mdx applies correct tags but would require a deep restyle to look right
  - [ ] might make sense to swap to Shiki at this point? already doing dynamic routes
- [ ] tooling
  - [ ] Storybook
  - [ ] unit tests? Playwright tests?
  - [ ] image optimization for static exports?
  - [ ] is there a need for any additional monorepo tooling? Yarn PnP? Turborepo?/Nx?
- [ ] features
  - [ ] tags index page & tag pages, someday
- [ ] UX
  - [ ] animate social pills on main screen? https://www.joshwcomeau.com/
- [ ] styling
  - [ ] use layers
  - [ ] banish `pageStyles` directory
  - [ ] find a neater way to handle `firstThree` in blog posts. don't wrap first 3 of _every_ paragraph anymore.
  - [ ] restyle so all pages can share `.centeringWrapper` etc. and Navbar can be pulled into the main layout
    - [ ] could then expand the use of grid from something that lives inside the blog post, to something used globally
    - [ ] that'd also let me make footer spacing really consistent, by defining it on the main wrapper
    - [ ] h2 seems smaller than h1 on some screens?
    - [ ] could also eliminate `.centeringWrapper` entirely, maybe? seems fine to remove from the navbar, at least
- [ ] basalt
  - [ ] simplify text ramp:
    - [ ] 32px main heading / ??? mobile, maybe 24
    - [ ] intermediate size for one level of subhead. no need for more
    - [ ] 24px main body text / 18px mobile
    - [ ] small text for UI elements and such?
  - [ ] improve breakpoints. do these really make sense?
  - [ ] handle font features in a more global way, so individual components don't need to set it
  - [ ] create a fallback for the MB fonts?
  - [ ] add semantic type tokens, make them responsive. probably need to settle out usage in the app better first.
  - [ ] look at Slot pattern from Radix, see if i need that for better polymorphism
    - [ ] get `ref`s working for polymorphic components?
    - [ ] figure out how to use `<Link>` also for Next links
  - [ ] add an h3
  - [ ] make sure `<em>` and `<strong>` work
- [ ] flesh out package READMEs
- [ ] put domain config into IaC w/ Terraform?
- [ ] SEO
  - [ ] get metadata tag working correctly on non-home pages
- [ ] style refactor
  - [ ] existing posts cleanup
    - [ ] b/w imagery for existing blogposts
    - [ ] more concise title & tagline
  - [ ] slideout side panel for extra controls/links?
    - [ ] new darkmode switcher - adopt ShadCN? https://www.shadcn.io/button/theme-switcher
    - [ ] colophon?
    - [ ] RSS link?
    - [ ] email?
    - [ ] move rest of navbar in there??
- [ ] add PGP key download link?
- [ ] make sure RSS works
- [ ] dedicated Identity page, then repurpose front page for something else
