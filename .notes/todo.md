# TODO

- [ ] code blocks
  - [ ] there's an error with `'` and `"` in Prism code blocks of unknown language, they turn into &quot;&quot;
  - [ ] make `code` blocks more legible
  - [ ] line numbers in code blocks - the line number plugin for remark-mdx seems somewhat borked, won't let me select a custom starting line
  - [ ] code block highlights - the highlight plugin for remark-mdx applies correct tags but would require a deep restyle to look right
  - [ ] might make sense to swap to Shiki at this point? already doing dynamic routes
- [ ] tooling
  - [ ] Storybook
  - [ ] unit tests? Playwright tests?
  - [ ] image optimization for static exports?
  - [ ] is there a need for any additional monorepo tooling? Yarn PnP? Turborepo?/Nx?

- [ ] MDX

  - [ ] find a neater way to handle `firstThree` in blog posts. don't wrap first 3 of _every_ paragraph anymore.
- [ ] basalt
  - [ ] simplify text ramp:
    - [ ] 32px main heading / ??? mobile, maybe 24
    - [ ] intermediate size for one level of subhead. no need for more
    - [ ] 24px main body text / 18px mobile
    - [ ] small text for UI elements and such?
  - [ ] improve breakpoints. do these really make sense?
  - [ ] handle font features in a more global way, so individual components don't need to set it
  - [ ] create a fallback for the MB fonts?
  - [ ] add semantic type tokens, make them responsive. probably need to settle out usage in the app better first.
  - [ ] look at Slot pattern from Radix, see if i need that for better polymorphism
    - [ ] get `ref`s working for polymorphic components?
    - [ ] figure out how to use `<Link>` also for Next links
  - [ ] add an h3
  - [ ] make sure `<em>` and `<strong>` work
  - [ ] animate Pill component? similar to https://www.joshwcomeau.com/
- [ ] flesh out package READMEs
- [ ] put domain config into IaC w/ Terraform?
- [ ] SEO
  - [ ] get metadata tag working correctly on non-home pages
- [ ] add PGP key download link?
- [ ] dedicated Identity page, then repurpose front page for something else? like Molly White's verify page: https://www.mollywhite.net/verify/
- [ ] how many of these can i do in a progressive-enhancement way?
  - [ ] light/dark mode. move JS logic to update mode out of react, into a page-level JS snippet. only show controls if JS active.
  - [ ] showy/hidey navbar - move handler to JS snippet, keep normal otherwise
  - [ ] slideout panel?
