# TODO

- tooling
  - [ ] unit tests in Next app? Playwright tests?
  - [ ] tighten lints to forbid non-Basalt values?
- vivsha.ws
  - [ ] tags index page & tag pages, someday
    - Tags in left sidebar?
  - ToC - like that one blog post https://aresluna.org/design-details-table-of-contents/
  - [ ] font flicker on hard refresh - could be a fallback problem?
  - ⚠ The Next.js plugin was not detected in your ESLint configuration. See https://nextjs.org/docs/app/api-reference/config/eslint#migrating-existing-config
- basalt
  - [ ] animate Pill component? similar to https://www.joshwcomeau.com/
  - [ ] Storybook
    - [ ] follow GH Primer example on token naming and docs pages? https://primer.style/product/primitives/token-names/
  - [ ] expand Text and Heading to also allow base sizes, then use in more places
- basalt-mdx
  - [ ] dial in heading spacing a bit more- should be asymmetrical, if it isn't
- writing
  - [ ] bring back old free speech post, with edits

## ideas

- dedicated Identity page, then repurpose front page for something else? like Molly White's verify page: https://www.mollywhite.net/verify/
