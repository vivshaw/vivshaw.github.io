# TODO

- [ ] code blocks
  - [ ] There's an error with `'` and `"` in Prism code blocks of unknown language, they turn into &quot;&quot;
  - [ ] Make `code` blocks more legible
  - [ ] Line numbers in code blocks - the line number plugin for remark-mdx seems somewhat borked, won't let me select a custom starting line
  - [ ] Code block highlights - the highlight plugin for remark-mdx applies correct tags but would require a deep restyle to look right
  - [ ] might make sense to swap to Shiki at this point? already doing dynamic routes
- [ ] tooling
  - [ ] Storybook
  - [ ] image optimization for static exports?
  - [ ] is there a need for any additional tooling? Yarn PnP? Turborepo?/Nx?
- [ ] features
  - [ ] tags index page & tag pages, someday
  - [ ] Get "Next Post" working for real
  - [ ] contact page?
- [ ] UX
  - [ ] new icon. dark mode icon would be sick whilst I'm at it.
  - [ ] darkmode switcher overlaps focus ring :(
- [ ] styling
  - [ ] obliterate `pageStyles` directory
  - [ ] restyle so all pages can share `.centeringWrapper` etc. and Navbar can be pulled into the main layout
    - [ ] could then expand the use of grid from something that lives inside the blog post, to something used globally
    - [ ] that'd also let me make footer spacing really consistent, by defining it on the main wrapper
    - [ ] h2 seems smaller than h1 on some screens?
- [ ] viriditas
  - [ ] adopt Sprinkles?
  - [ ] start building out components. maybe start with Box, or Typography
- [ ] flesh out package READMEs
- [ ] get rid of ugly typecasts and disorganized logic in the metadata helpers
- [ ] stop using Adobe fonts so I can host locally and preload. go directly through Canada Type
- [ ] fix odd `tsconfig.json` problems - why can't I extend the root `tsconfig` in the Next.js one?
- [ ] put domain config into IaC w/ Terraform
