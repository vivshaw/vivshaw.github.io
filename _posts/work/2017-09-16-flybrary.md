{{ page.excerpt }}

[Flybrary](https://my-reads-vivshaw.herokuapp.com/) is a LibraryThing-esque library management app that keeps track of what books you're reading. The app uses React & react-router to build a [progressive web app](https://developers.google.com/web/progressive-web-apps/) front-end for a RESTful books API. It has a responsive, mobile-first style built with Material-UI and styled-components that should look equally great on mobile, tablet, or desktop. I built it for the first project of Udacity's [React nanodegree](https://www.udacity.com/course/react-nanodegree--nd019).

I used it as an opportunity to explore not just core React, but the full modern JS dev toolchain. The app is written in [Flow](https://flow.org/), and I'm using Jest and Enzyme for a full test suite, [JSDoc](http://usejsdoc.org/) comments with [documentation.js](http://documentation.js.org/) for documentation generation, and [Gulp](https://gulpjs.com/) for task automation. The app is set up with a full continuous integration & continuous deployment toolchain using [CircleCI](https://circleci.com/), [CodeClimate](https://codeclimate.com/), and [Heroku](https://heroku.com/).

I also played with some of the React ecosystem's more cutting-edge features. I used [react-loadable](https://github.com/thejameskyle/react-loadable) for code splitting & lazy loading, and [react-snapshot](https://github.com/geelen/react-snapshot) for static prerendering (not quite as snazzy as server-side rendering, but it did give me an awesome perf boost!).

This is probably the most fun I've ever had working on the front-end. While it wasn't my first time with React, this was the first time I've worked with many of the other technologies, and I feel the experienced really deepened my understanding of JS development. It's also the first time I've built anything that works offline, which was super cool! I did get bogged down by state management purgatory toward the end though, so I think it's due for an eventual refactor into a proper Redux architecture.

The code is, of course, all [on my GitHub](https://github.com/vivshaw/my-reads).
