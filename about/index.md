I'm a developer from Burlington, Vermont. I'm an alumna of the University of Vermont, with a B.A. in Economics and Philosophy. My central interests are in developing modern, data-driven web applications, the React/Redux ecosystem, and machine learning. Javascript and Python are my home at the moment, although I'm trying to expand my palette with some C++ and Ruby. I'm currently in the middle of a deep dive into React via the Udacity React Nanodegree.

When I'm not coding, you'll generally find me reading weird fiction, cycling, stir-frying things, watching Cronenberg films, or noodling around with my synthesizers.

You can find me on Twitter at [@irreduce](https://twitter.com/irreduce) and on GitHub at [vivshaw](https://github.com/vivshaw).
