This rule describes the nature of the `vivsha.ws` repo.

# What it is

This is Hannah Vivian Shaw's personal blog and website.

# How it's structured

## Code

This repo is a Yarn monorepo, split into three separate Yarn packages:

 - @vivshaw/vivshaws (`./apps/vivsha.ws`), the blog application itself
 - @vivshaw/viriditas (`./packages/viriditas`), the design system used to build it
 - @vivshaw/mdx (`./packages/mdx`), a package of MDX components used to render Markdown in the app

Each of these pacakges has its own `README.md` you can reference.

## Writing

The blog posts themselves live outside the code, in the `./posts/` directory.

## Notes

The `./.notes/` directory is a scratch space for any miscellaneous notes and TODOs.

# How it's built

This application uses React and Next.js as its foundation. It uses Next's App Router.

The app is written in Typescript.

Styling is done with Vanilla Extract. The Sprinkles and Recipes sub-packages are available.
