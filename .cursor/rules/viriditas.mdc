# Component Organization

Components in the Viriditas design system follow this structure:
- Each component lives in its own file in `packages/viriditas/components/`
- Components are accompanied by their stories (`.stories.tsx`) and styles (`.css.ts`)
- All components must be exported through the `components/index.ts` file
- Component imports should always come from "@vivshaw/viriditas/components" rather than deep imports

# Styling

Styling is done with Vanilla Extract, including Sprinkles and Recipes when needed.
