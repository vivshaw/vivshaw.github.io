# client

All parts of Basalt that require client-side React live in here. These are _fully optional_- Basalt was built to be fully compatible with React Server Components. The optional client-side tools provided are a provider and hook to read and update the current Basalt color mode. This can be used to build things like a light mode / dark mode switcher.
